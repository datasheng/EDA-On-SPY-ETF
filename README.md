# Exploratory Data Analysis On SPY ETF
I felt that it wouldn't be unreasonable to choose my own dataset outside of the link given as long as it fits the requirements requested, since I will most likely need to use this dataset anyways for my team's final project.

### Contents of notebook
In spy.ipynb, I demonstrated use cases for different Pandas methods. This was followed by data plotting mostly with the seaborn library for sns.barplot, sns.histplot, sns.heatmap, and sns.pairplot which were used in the DataCamp course on Seaborn. These graphs were used on the SPY ETF dataset, specifically in the years 2020 and 2021 when the COVID-19 pandemic were extremely relevant, thus investigating a relevance of the stock market vs. the global impact of the pandemic on the economy.
